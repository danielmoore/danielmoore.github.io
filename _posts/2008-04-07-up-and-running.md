So I got tired of the old site and decided to push ahead plans to get v2 of NorthHorizon up and running. Work will be commencing soon to get a fresh, original theme for the site up, hopefully from [a friend of mine](http://inversesip.com).

I&#8217;m going to get a post up soon with some really interesting ideas and technologies Chris and I have been working on in WPF and .NET 3.5 and get down to the fun stuff.
