This semester I&#8217;m taking several electives to finish up my degree. One of the courses I&#8217;m taking is Object Oriented Programming Systems, formerly Object Oriented Analysis and Design. I have yet to find a suitable explanation as to why OOaD was cut and reformed at the graduate level, but I&#8217;m assuming it was because it was a bit too advanced for <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">some</span> many of the people I find in my major. In its stead, we now have a much more aptly abbreviated course.

In any case, my professor is a big proponent of Java, the Waterfall \[[Software Development Life Cycle|SDLC]\] (which he dubs &#8220;the generic SDLC.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t aware wet sand was considered &#8220;the generic foundation&#8221;) and, of course, all the misery that comes with it.<!--more-->

For one of our more recent homework assignments, we were given the trivial task of converting a four Java classes from a previous assignment into UML diagrams. We were obviously applying what we learned in class by putting the cart in front of the horse. Our assignment was to be done in [[Jude (UML Tool)|JUDE]] of [all things](http://jude.change-vision.com/jude-web/product/img/er_index_en.jpg). In the interests of full disclosure, I am completely spoiled in terms of tools to use. Microsoft, through its godsend of [[MSDNAA]] makes Christmas just about every day of the year for me. Sure I know it&#8217;s a form of product marketing &#8211; analogous to giving crack to kids &#8211; but have you _used_ their stuff? It&#8217;s head and shoulders above _everything_ else, and in many cases is the paradigm to which the industry **only seeks to make parity with**. With that being said, I&#8217;m hoping you&#8217;ll understand my&#8230; disposition against Fischer Price&#8217;s JUDE product. Instead of trudging through the installation of a clearly inferior product, ripping my hair out trying to understand the UI, and eventually producing a diagram that my 5-year-old cousin could have drawn better, I decided that I would use Visio instead. I made my diagrams down to the letter and they looked _beautiful_. I spent extra time making sure that the positioning of each class reduced the nmber of times connections intersected and made especially sure that everything was clear. I saved it out as a PDF, so as to be platform agnostic, and submitted it.

I wasn&#8217;t nearly as surprised as I was _livid_ when I found out that I had been deducted 50% credit on the _sole_ basis of, &#8220;it&#8217;s not a .jude file.&#8221; _That_ is the kind of [arrant pedantry](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/churchill.html) up with which I will not put. To me, it&#8217;s really the equivalent of me asking you to write a paper on Shakespeare in blue ink. I&#8217;d suppose a lot of people would remark, &#8220;well, I write in blue ink anyway, so it&#8217;s not a big deal,&#8221; and continue on. Still more would say, &#8220;normally I write in black ink, but I&#8217;ll comply because it seems like a trivial request, and not worth the fight.&#8221; This would probably leave me by myself stating emphatically that it is _unreasonable_ to be concerned with the color of the ink that I write in juxtaposed against the magnitude of writing a paper on Shakespeare. Of course, I&#8217;d comply if the reasoning for the requirement of blue ink was enumerated, so long as it wasn&#8217;t arbitrary.

Perhaps even more important than the freedom aspect of the scenario is the abject _insanity_ that revolves around diagrams. Who cares if your diagram was written in Visio, JUDE, Rhapsody, or on a whiteboard? **_It&#8217;s a diagram_**. The concept of [[WYSIWYG]] is almost an understatement. It might be argued that JUDE is an &#8220;enterprise application&#8221; and my good professor is trying to do me a favor by showing me a tool that&#8217;s used in the &#8220;real world.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think I would ever want to work for an employer that says, &#8220;We see  UML on your résumé, but while we think you&#8217;re smart enough to work on our codebase, we don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re smart enough to learn to use the UML tool we have.&#8221;

I think it&#8217;s more important to state the objectives of any assignment, be it professional or educational, and let the person doing the work choose the best way to accomplish it. Nobody likes a micromanager. Especially me.
